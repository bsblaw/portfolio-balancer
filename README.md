# portfolio-balancer

## Project Description

Google Apps Script project that takes bank statements (in CSV format) and generate a Google Sheet showing a consolidated view of the entire portfolio. The consolidated view contains information on how investments are distributed between configurable investment categories. 

## Why?

For investors with funds scattered across multiple financial institutions and/or accounts, a consolidated view of one's portfolio is often difficult to obtain. Knowing how the entire pool of money is distributed between investment categories is of special interest for passive investors, whose investment strategy involves continually monitoring and rebalancing the portfolio in order to maintain proper diversitification. This tool aimed at making this information readily available, which in turn informs buy/sell decisions, especially for passive investors primarily concerned with maintaining a balanced portfolio.
